## Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity**: System should be modular and loosely coupled
2. **Scalability**: System should support horizontal and vertical scaling
3. **Reliability**: System should be highly available and fault-tolerant
4. **Security**: System should be secure and compliant with regulations
5. **Maintainability**: System should be easy to maintain and extend
6. **Performance**: System should meet performance requirements
7. **Cost-Effectiveness**: System should be cost-effective to operate

6. **Baseline**: Architecture baselined for development

## Architecture Decisions Records (ADR)

Each architecture decision should be recorded in ADR format:
- **Title**: Short descriptive title
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision
- **Decision**: What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change
